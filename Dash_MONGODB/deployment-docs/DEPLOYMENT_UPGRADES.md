## Upgrade 1: Fixed Docker Volume Data Persistence

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Status:** Completed

### What We Achieved

Fixed a critical data persistence issue where MongoDB data was being lost every time containers were restarted. The volume configuration was incorrectly mapping to the wrong directory, causing the database to start fresh with each deployment.

### Before vs After

**Before (Broken Configuration):**
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/data
```
- Used bind mount pointing to wrong directory
- MongoDB data directory is /data/db, but we were mapping to /data
- Data was lost on every container restart
- Manual database restoration required after each deployment
- No persistent storage management

**After (Fixed Configuration):**
```yaml
volumes:
  - mongodb_data:/data/db
  - ./mongo-dump:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro
environment:
  - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=research_db_structure
```
- Uses Docker-managed named volume
- Correctly maps to MongoDB's actual data directory (/data/db)
- Data persists through container restarts and removals
- Automatic database initialization from dump files
- Docker handles all persistence management

### What This Means

**Reliability Improvements:**
- Database data now survives container restarts
- System reboots no longer cause data loss
- Updates and rebuilds maintain all existing data
- No manual intervention needed after deployments

**Operational Benefits:**
- Eliminates need for manual database restoration
- Reduces deployment time and complexity
- Prevents accidental data loss during maintenance
- Improves disaster recovery capabilities

**Technical Details:**
- Volume Type: Named volume (Docker-managed)
- Mount Point: /data/db (MongoDB standard)
- Persistence: Automatic across container lifecycle
- Auto-initialization: Configured for first-time setup

### Verification Results

All persistence tests passed successfully:
- Container restart test: Data intact (39 users, 6,700 documents)
- Complete shutdown test: Data survived removal and recreation
- All collections verified: chercheurs (181), publications (4,527), institutions (1,264), collaborations (131), stats_pays (558), users (39)

### Files Modified

- `docker-compose.yml`: Updated mongo service volume configuration

### Testing Performed

1. Initial data restoration and verification
2. Container restart persistence test
3. Complete container removal and recreation test
4. Document count verification across all collections
5. Volume existence verification after shutdown

### Rollback Procedure

If issues occur, revert docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/data
```
Then manually restore database from backups located in `./backups/`

### Future Considerations

- Implement automated backup strategy for the named volume
- Consider volume snapshots for additional redundancy
- Monitor volume size growth over time
- Document volume backup and restore procedures

## Upgrade 2: Environment Configuration System

**Date:** Planned  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Not Started

### Planned Improvements

Create a proper environment variable management system to separate development and production configurations.

**Current Issues:**
- Hardcoded values in docker-compose.yml
- No separation between development and production settings
- Secrets exposed in version control

**Planned Changes:**
- Create .env file for environment-specific variables
- Move sensitive data to environment variables
- Create separate production configuration
- Add .env to .gitignore for security

**Expected Benefits:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Improved security for secrets
- Easier environment switching
- Better configuration management

## Upgrade 3: Container Health Checks

**Date:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started

### Planned Improvements

Add health monitoring to ensure containers only start when their dependencies are ready.

**Current Issues:**
- Services start even if dependencies aren't ready
- No automated health monitoring
- API may attempt to connect before MongoDB is ready

**Planned Changes:**
- Add MongoDB health check using mongosh ping
- Add API health check endpoint
- Add Streamlit health check
- Configure proper dependency waiting with health conditions

**Expected Benefits:**
- Guaranteed service availability on startup
- Automatic restart on service failures
- Better debugging of startup issues
- Improved deployment reliability

## Upgrade 4: Health Endpoint Implementation

**Date:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started

### Planned Improvements

Create dedicated health check endpoint in the FastAPI service.

**Planned Changes:**
- Add /health endpoint to API
- Test database connectivity in health check
- Return proper HTTP status codes (200/503)
- Include service metadata in response

**Expected Benefits:**
- Easy integration with monitoring tools
- Support for Docker health checks
- Better observability and debugging
- Load balancer compatibility

---

## Upgrade 5: Resource Limits and Constraints

**Date:** Planned  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Status:** Not Started

### Planned Improvements

Implement resource limits to prevent containers from consuming unlimited system resources.

**Current Issues:**
- Containers can use all available CPU and memory
- Risk of resource starvation
- No capacity planning

**Planned Changes:**
- MongoDB: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM limit
- API: 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM limit
- Streamlit: 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM limit
- Add resource reservations for guaranteed minimums

**Expected Benefits:**
- Predictable resource usage
- Better system stability
- Prevents resource starvation
- Enables better capacity planning

## Upgrade 6: Multi-Stage Docker Builds

**Date:** Planned  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Not Started

### Planned Improvements

Optimize Docker images using multi-stage builds to reduce size and improve security.

**Current Issues:**
- Large image sizes with build dependencies
- Build tools present in production images
- Slow image pulls and deployments

**Planned Changes:**
- Separate build and production stages
- Remove build dependencies from final images
- Use non-root user for security
- Minimize final image layers

**Expected Benefits:**
- 50-70% reduction in image size
- Faster deployments and updates
- Improved security posture
- Reduced attack surface
